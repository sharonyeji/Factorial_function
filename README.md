[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/chapman-cs510-2017f/hw-04-sharonyeji.svg?token=hJEphYAtMGK54UkG3eh4&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/chapman-cs510-2017f/hw-04-sharonyeji)

## Specification

1. Complete the classwork, in collaboration with your group (using Slack as needed). 
1. Create a Jupyter notebook ```hw04-fibonacci.ipynb``` that imports and uses your code from Homework 03. (You will need to copy the files into this repository first.) Format it in a nice way to present your previous results. Explain both the original fibonacci implementation, as well as the generator implementation, and how the two implementations differ. 
1. Create a new python module ```factorial.py```. Implement three functions ```fac1(n)```, ```fac2(n)```, and ```fac3(n)```, that each take a positive integer ```n``` and returns its factorial ```n!``` as a single number. Recall that the factorial is defined as ```n! = n(n-1)(n-2)...(3)(2)(1)```, i.e., the product of all positive integers less than or equal to ```n```. Implement the first two factorial functions without generators, but in different ways. Implement the third factorial function as a function wrapper around a generator. In a separate file ```test_factorial.py```, write test functions for each one to verify that they are working properly. Verify that after committing to GitHub the tests pass correctly and produce a green icon at the top of the README file.
1. Create a Jupyter notebook ```hw04-factorial.ipynb``` that imports your factorial module. Format the notebook in a nice way and present your results. Describe how each implementation works in a separate section, and explain your design decisions. Use the ```%time``` and ```%timeit``` magic functions to benchmark your implementations. Which is faster? Speculate why. Commit all notebooks and modules to GitHub.
1. Start reading the slides on how classes work in Python. I highly recommend writing the code and following along, testing it in an ipython3 interpreter as you go, to make sure you understand how everything works.

## Assessment

Analyze in this section what you found useful about this assignment in your own words. Include any lingering questions or comments that you may have.

**This homework was another great exercise to build on the knowledge that was gained in the previous classwork and homework. Practicing in the Jupyter notebook helped me be more comfortable with formalizing my findings and verbally explaining what is going on in my algorithms. Creating factorial.py was very simple, but I believe I was supposed to use the "name=main" code, and realized that I havent fully grasped how to use it to prevent my module from running in another python file. It was great that %time and %timeit was introduced because it can tangibly be used to test if one algorithm is more efficient than another.**

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.
