    "In the original implementation of the fibonacci sequence, it started with the empty list retList. Then a for loop was created so that the list would be filled with the fibonacci sequence. The variables f1 and f2 were defined as 1 and 1. Their values were added to each other and renamed to a new variable fn. The variable f2 was then renamed to equal fn. This all occurs in the for loop and the step is repeated until n values are appended into retList."

    "\n",
    "These two implementations are similar in the way the fibonacci sequence is determined. However they differ because the original implementation uses a for loop to append an empty list, whereas the 2nd implementation uses a generator to first define the numbers that are in the fibonacci sequence, then fill those numbers in an empty list with another function."
